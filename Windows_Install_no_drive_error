# 🧰 Windows VM – “No Drives Found” During Installation in Proxmox

## 🧩 Problem
While installing **Windows 10/11** or **Windows Server** inside **Proxmox VE**, the Windows Setup screen displayed:

> “No drives were found. Click Load Driver to provide a mass storage driver for installation.”

Even though the virtual hard disk was properly configured, Windows could not detect it.

---

## ⚙️ Cause
Proxmox uses **VirtIO drivers** to provide optimized, high-performance virtual hardware. However, Windows installation media **does not include** these drivers by default. As a result, the virtualized storage device is invisible to the Windows installer.

---

## 🪄 Solution

### 1️⃣ Download and upload VirtIO drivers to Proxmox
From the official Fedora repository:  
🔗 [Download virtio-win.iso](https://fedorapeople.org/groups/virt/virtio-win/direct-downloads/latest-virtio/)

Upload this ISO to your Proxmox **ISO Storage** (e.g., `local:iso` or `iso-storage`).

---

### 2️⃣ Attach VirtIO ISO to the VM
In the Proxmox web interface:
1. Select your Windows VM  
2. Go to **Hardware → Add → CD/DVD Drive**  
3. Choose **Use ISO Image** → select `virtio-win.iso`  
4. Set the **Bus/Device** to `IDE` or `SATA` (not VirtIO for the CD drive)

---

### 3️⃣ Restart the VM
Reboot (or stop/start) the VM so the installer can see both ISOs:
- Windows installation ISO  
- VirtIO driver ISO  

---

### 4️⃣ Load the storage driver in Windows setup
When prompted to select a driver:
1. Click **Load Driver → Browse**  
2. Navigate to the VirtIO CD (usually `D:` or `E:`)  
3. Open the folder matching your OS version:
   ```
   viostor > w10    # for Windows 10 / 11
   viostor > 2k19   # for Windows Server 2019
   viostor > 2k22   # for Windows Server 2022
   ```
4. Click **OK** → select the driver → continue installation  
Your virtual disk should now appear.

---

### 5️⃣ Complete setup and install full VirtIO tools
Once Windows is installed:
1. Mount the VirtIO ISO again in Proxmox  
2. Inside Windows, open the CD and run:
   ```
   virtio-win-guest-tools.exe
   ```
This installs all VirtIO components (storage, network, balloon driver, QEMU guest agent, etc.)

---

## 🧠 Lessons Learned
- Proxmox’s VirtIO devices offer **enterprise-grade performance**, but require manual drivers for Windows installs.  
- Always keep a copy of the **latest VirtIO ISO** in your Proxmox ISO library.  
- Troubleshooting missing storage drivers simulates **real help desk and IT support scenarios** — valuable experience for SOC and IT admin roles.

### ✅ Example VM Hardware Configuration
| Component | Setting |
|------------|----------|
| Disk | `SCSI` using VirtIO SCSI controller |
| Network | `VirtIO (paravirtualized)` |
| CD/DVD 1 | Windows installation ISO |
| CD/DVD 2 | VirtIO drivers ISO |
| BIOS | `OVMF (UEFI)` or `SeaBIOS` |
| Display | `Default` |
| Memory | 4–8 GB |
| CPU | 2–4 cores |

## 🧾 Summary for GitHub
This issue occurred during the setup of a Windows VM within my Proxmox-based homelab. Windows Setup failed to detect the virtual disk because the VirtIO drivers were not preloaded in the installation ISO. After adding the **virtio-win.iso** as a secondary CD/DVD drive and manually loading the correct driver, Windows successfully recognized the disk and installation continued normally.  

This experience reinforced the importance of understanding virtualization hardware layers and driver dependencies — both critical skills for IT Help Desk and SOC analyst workflows.
